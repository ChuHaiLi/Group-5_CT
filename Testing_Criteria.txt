1.Core Functionality: 
Do all buttons, input fields, and links work?
User Input: 
Does the system correctly capture all user profile data (preferences, budget, etc.) for a session?
Data Display: 
Is all data from the static dataset (locations, guides) displayed correctly?
Maps: 
Does the map component load? 
Are routes and distances calculated and displayed?
Weather:
Is the correct, real-time weather from the API displayed for a given location?
Simulation Check: 
Do the "booking" buttons trigger the correct simulated confirmation message ?
Session State: 
Does the system correctly reset when a new session begins ?

2.Logic and Intelligent:
Preference Matching: 
If a user inputs "culture" and "low budget," does the system prioritize temples and street food over nightclubs and 5-star hotels?
Exclusion: 
Does the system successfully filter out locations that don't match ?
Recommendation Ranking: 
Is the #1 recommended item logically the best fit based on the combination of rules ?
"Hot Trend" Simulation:
Does the system correctly identify a location as a "hot trend" based on your team's defined threshold ?
Route Optimization Logic:
When 3+ points are selected, does the system generate a logical route ?
Does the total travel time/cost calculation seem accurate based on the optimized path?
Weather Alert: 
If the weather data for a location shows "Rain," does the system correctly trigger an alert (e.g., "Heavy rain - suggest indoor activity")?
Opportunity Alert:
If the user's GPS is "near" a high-matching or "hot trend" location, does the "Opportunity Module" alert trigger?

3. User Experience (UX) & Interface (UI)
Clarity & Readability: 
Is the text easy to read? Are icons clear?
Ease of Use: 
How easy is it to create a user profile and input preferences? 
Is the process intuitive?
Information Hierarchy: 
Is the most important information (Name, Rating, Video) presented clearly on the recommendation list?
Video Review Feature: 
Is the integration of video reviews smooth? Does it add value as intended?
Workflow: 
Is the flow from planning (input) to recommendation (output) to itinerary (final plan) logical and smooth?

4. Data Handling & Integration
Static Dataset: 
Is the 10-15 entry static dataset used fully? 
Are you able to search, find, and get recommendations for all items in it?

Test: Does a "Bad Weather" API response actively change the recommendation list to favor indoor activities?
Test: Does the "Distance" from the Maps API actively influence the ranking of recommendations?
Data Accuracy: 
Are there obvious errors in how data is displayed (e.t., wrong name, wrong image, incorrect weather)? (Tolerated per your constraints, but should be noted).
